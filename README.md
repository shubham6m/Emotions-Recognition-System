# Emotions-Recognition-System
This repository contains project "Emotions recognition System" which detects the human's emotions using Camera.

**Emotion Recognition System**
This project is a Human Emotion Recognition System designed to detect and classify human emotions in real time using a camera feed. Built with Python, the system leverages powerful libraries and modules for image processing, facial feature extraction, and machine learning.

**Features**
1. Real-time emotion detection via webcam or camera feed.
2. Recognizes emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.
3. Uses advanced image processing techniques and pre-trained machine learning models for high accuracy.
4. Modular and extensible codebase for easy customization and enhancement.
   
**Build With :**
1. Python: The core programming language.
2. OpenCV: For capturing and processing video frames.
3. dlib / Mediapipe: For facial landmark detection.
4. TensorFlow/Keras: For building and deploying deep learning models
5. NumPy: For numerical computations.
6. Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

**How It Works**
1. Captures video frames from a camera feed using OpenCV.
2. Detects the face in each frame and extracts key facial features.
3. Analyzes these features with a trained emotion classification model.
4. Displays the predicted emotion in real-time with visual indicators.

**Use Cases**
1. Enhancing human-computer interaction by adapting interfaces based on user emotions.
2. Monitoring mental health and well-being.
3. Applications in marketing to gauge customer reactions.
4. Enabling smart surveillance systems for behavior analysis.
